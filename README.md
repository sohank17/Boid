# Boid

Considering flocks of birds as our case study, we try to implement three basic rules followed by individuals (based on Craig Reynolds’s study) – separation (avoid coming in another’s path), alignment (stay tuned with where and how those nearby are going) and finally, cohesion (keep distance but stick together), and try to see how they form flocks.

We have referred the code from https://p5js.org/examples/simulate-flocking.html for the basic rules and then built our own rules for predators and obstacles.
In order to run the simulation follow the below steps:

1. Open the index.html on any browser to view the simulation.
2. In order to change the simulation follow the instructions as mentioned in the sketch.js file. Inorder to change other values like max speed and max magnitude 
make changes to the boid.js file.To view the js files you can use Notepad or any other code editor of your choice.
