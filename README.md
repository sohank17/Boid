# Boid

We have referred the code from https://p5js.org/examples/simulate-flocking.html for the basic rules and then built our own rules for predators and obstacles since we didn't have prior knowledge on JavaScript.
In order to run the simulation dollow the below steps:

1. Open the index.html on any browser to view the simulation.
2. In order to change the simulation follow the instructions as mentioned in the sketch.js file. Inorder to change other values like max speed and max magnitude 
make changes to the boid.js file.To view the js files you can use Notepad or any other code editor of your choice.
